# Handwriting Recognition

## Recognize Handwritten Digits

This is a demo of Algorithmia's [DigitRecognizer](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/mahout/DigitRecognizer) and [DigitRecognition](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/weka/DigitRecognition)
algorithms. Write a number by hand, and the algorithms will identify it.
