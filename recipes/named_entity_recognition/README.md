# Retrieve Tweets By Keyword and Find Named Entities

This script will call the Twitter API for keyword related Tweets, clean the data using regex, and then run it through named entity recognition. 

With the output we get from the algorithm the data will then be grouped by the category each named entity is assigned to, and then extract the categories we are interested in.
