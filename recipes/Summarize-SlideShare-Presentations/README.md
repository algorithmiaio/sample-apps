# Automatic Slideshare Text Summarization

This script will use the [Extract Text](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/util/ExtractText) algorithm and the [Summarizer](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/Summarizer) algorithm to show how to scrape and summarize the text from a SlideShare presentation.
For the full blog post related to this recipe, see [Automatic Slideshare Text Summarization](http://blog.algorithmia.com/automatic-slideshare-text-summarization/).
