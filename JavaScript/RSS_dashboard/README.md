# RSS Dashboard

## Extract summaries, tags, and sentiment from an RSS feed

This is a demo of several of Algorithmia's website inspection and text analysis tools, including:
* [Scrape RSS](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/tags/ScrapeRSS) - parses an RSS feed, extracting each entry's title and url
* [HTML2Text](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/util/Html2Text) - converts the main content of an HTML page to plain text
* [Summarizer](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/Summarizer) - creates a summary by extracting topic sentences based on frequency of key terms
* [AutoTag](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/AutoTag) - uses a variant of [nlp/LDA](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/LDA) to extract keywords.
* [Sentiment Analysis](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/SentimentAnalysis) - assigns a sentiment rating from -1 (very negative) to to 1 (very positive).

This tool takes a URL for an RSS feed, and automatically generates tags, text summaries, and sentiment analysis.
