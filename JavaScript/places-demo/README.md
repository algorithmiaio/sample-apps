# Scene Recognition

## Use Deep Learning to Identify and Classify Places

This is a demo of the [Places365Classifier](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/deeplearning/Places365Classifier) running on Algorithmia, which uses state-of-the-art deep learning to identify places in images.  Simply paste in a URL or upload a file to quickly classify places, locations, and scenes in images.
