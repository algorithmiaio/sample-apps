# Web Page Inspector

## An API to instantly retrieve clean, structured data from any URL

This is a demo of several of Algorithmia's webpage inspection and text analysis tools, including:
* [Analyze URL](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/web/AnalyzeURL) - takes a URL and returns several pieces of structured data
* [Summarizer](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/Summarizer) - creates a summary of the most important points of the original document
* [Social Sentiment Analysis](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/SocialSentimentAnalysis) - assigns sentiment ratings of "positive", "negative" and "neutral"
* [Count Social Shares](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/web/ShareCounts) - returns the number of times that URL has been shared on various social media sites
* [Get Links](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/web/GetLinks) - scrapes the page for all the links and returns them as URL strings
* [Get Image Links](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/diego/Getimagelinks) - return a list of all the image URLs
* [Auto-Tag URL](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/tags/AutoTagURL) - produces candidate tags using LDA

With this demo, one can instantly examine a webpage, summarize the content and sentiment of each page, see suggested tags, and count social shares.
